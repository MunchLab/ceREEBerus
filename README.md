# ceREEBerus

ceREEBerus is a Python package that allows you to perform various operations and analysis on Reeb graphs. The main goal of this package is to implement the available theoretical work on the Reeb graph interleaving distance and its variants for use in applied and machine learning contexts.

## Features

- Generate Reeb graphs from input data
- Visualize Reeb graphs in a clear and intuitive way
- Perform topological analysis on Reeb graphs
- Extract critical points and features from Reeb graphs
- Apply various algorithms and techniques to analyze Reeb graphs

## Installation

You can either update the latest version from pip using

```
pip install cereeberus
```

or to work with the most up to date version, you can clone the repo and install with

```{sh}
git clone git@github.com:MunchLab/ceREEBerus.git
cd ceREEBerus
pip install .
```
