- [ ] I have incremented the version number in the `pyproject.toml` file if a new version needs to be pushed to pypi. *Note that if the number isn't incremented, the package will not be pushed to pypi, which is useful if this PR is only for updating documentation.*
- [ ] My code follows the code style of this project and I have run `make format` to clean up the code with `black`.
- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation. I have updated the documentation as necessary and compiled locally to ensure it is clean.
- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes, and all new and existing tests passed (run `make tests`).
