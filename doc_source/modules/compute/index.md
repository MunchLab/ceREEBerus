# Compute Module

The compute module has code for computations on Reeb graphs and merge trees. However, this has largely been deprecated in version 0.1.0 so enter at your own risk.


```{eval-rst}
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
    Degree <compute_degree.rst>
    Draw <compute_draw.rst>
    Merge <compute_merge.rst>
    Union Find <compute_uf.rst>
    Distance <compute_distance.rst>
```
